# PRODIGY-CS-02

**🔐 Image Encryption Tool**

A lightweight image encryption and decryption tool built using Python. This project applies basic pixel manipulation techniques—such as swapping pixel values and performing mathematical transformations—to obscure image data and then restore it. It's a beginner-friendly project that blends image processing with introductory cybersecurity concepts.


**🚀 Features**

- 🔁 Encrypt and decrypt images using simple pixel transformations
- 🧮 Mathematical and logical operations for pixel value changes
- 🖼️ Supports common image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG)
- 💻 Lightweight and easy to understand codebase
